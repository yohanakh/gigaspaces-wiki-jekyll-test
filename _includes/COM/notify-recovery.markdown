# Notify-Recovery
When a partitioned space is started each partition getting list of existing notify registrations from the other partitions. This is useful when the partition fails and restarted. This avoids the client side to re-issue a new notify registrations against the restarted partition. If you are not using notifications or running a partitioned space with backups you may disable this mechanism using the `cluster-config.notify-recovery` property (boolean property). This will speed up the space deployment time since when a partition looking for the other partitions and these have not been started yet, it might take some time for the entire clustered space to be fully available. By default this property is *enabled* (true).
